Dev Notes:
 * Handling CRUD Actions
    - Create (user sends curl post request)
      > Example URL: curl -i \
                     -H "Accept: application/json" \
                     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                     -X POST -d '{"start_time":"11/7/17 13:30","end_time":"11/7/17 13:40", "first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Golik"}' \
                     http://localhost:3000/appointments
    - Update (user sends curl post request)
    - Delete (user sends curl post request)
    - List (user sends search params thru url)
 * Must return valid json
 * Times must be in the future
 * Times cannot overlap existing appointment on the same day

To Do:
