### Testing Note
###
### I'm switching over to testing the create method so that I can have appointments
### in different months and years than the provided appointment data. I need that
### data to properly test my year and month searches.

### Why are they all GET requests?
###
### I set up my code to use GET requests for all four of the CLUD methods. I wanted
### this API to be as user-friendly as possible and I felt that would best be done
### by asking the user to choose the method in the URL params rather than a more
### complicated cURL request.

GET http://localhost:3000?m=create&first_name=mike&last_name=gregory&start_time=6/5/16 11:30&end_time=6/5/16 11:45
> Expected to create new appointment
++++++ F A I L U R E
> Error1: "Start time is either (a) not properly formatted, or (b) in the past."
> Error2: "End time is either (a) not properly formatted, or (b) in the past."
  >> Validation worked correctly; test was run at 11:13 PM, but appointment was
     being created at 11:30 AM.

GET http://localhost:3000?m=create&first_name=mike&last_name=gregory&start_time=6/10/16 9:30&end_time=6/10/16 10:00
> Expected appointment to be created with dates saved in UTC correctly
> Used same request with change from 'm=create' to 'm=list' in order to test that creation was successful
> DateTime & timezone issues appear resolved
> SUCCESS

Testing for: Invalid date in start_time
