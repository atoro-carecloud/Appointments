Testing for: (m=list) Root lists all appointments
GET http://localhost:3000/
> Should return all appointments in json
> SUCCESS

Testing for: (m=list) '/appointments' lists all appointments
GET http://localhost:3000/appointments
> Should return all appointments in json
> SUCCESS

Testing for: (m=list) Search by first_name works
GET http://localhost:3000?first_name=dawn
> Should return all appointments with first name 'dawn'
> SUCCESS

Testing for: (m=list) Search by last_name works
GET http://localhost:3000?last_name=robins
> Should return all appointments (one in this case) with last name 'robins'
> SUCCESS

Testing for: (m=list) Search by first_name & last_name works
GET http://localhost:3000?first_name=dawn&last_name=robins
> Should return all appointments (one in this case) with the name 'dawn robins'
> SUCCESS

Testing for: (m=list) Search with capitalized name still works
GET http://localhost:3000?first_name=dawn&last_name=Robins
> Testing if capital letters throw off the search
> Should return all appointments (one in this case) with the name 'dawn robins'
> SUCCESS

Testing for: (m=list) Explicitly choosing list method works
GET http://localhost:3000?first_name=dawn&last_name=robins&m=list
> Should list by default but should still list if declared explicitly
> Should return all appointments (one in this case) with the name 'dawn robins'
> SUCCESS

### Testing Note
###
### I'm switching over to testing the create method so that I can have appointments
### in different months and years than the provided appointment data. I need that
### data to properly test my year and month searches.

### Why are they all GET requests?
###
### I set up my code to use GET requests for all four of the CLUD methods. I wanted
### this API to be as user-friendly as possible and I felt that would best be done
### by asking the user to choose the method in the same way they list the URL params
### rather than requiring the user to know how to use cURL/Postman/HTTParty.

Testing for: (m=create) Dates are converted and saved correctly, explicitly choosing create method works
GET http://localhost:3000?m=create&first_name=mike&last_name=gregory&start_time=6/10/16 9:30&end_time=6/10/16 10:00
> Expected appointment to be created with dates saved in UTC correctly
> Used same request with change from 'm=create' to 'm=list' in order to test that creation was successful
> DateTime & timezone issues appear resolved
> SUCCESS

Testing for: (m=list) Invalid date in start_time
GET http://localhost:3000?m=list&first_name=mike&last_name=gregory&start_time=6/100/16 9:30&end_time=6/10/16 10:00
> Returns error about incorrect date_format
> Successful Failure

Testing for: (m=create) Capital names are saved downcase
GET http://localhost:3000?m=create&first_name=Mike&last_name=Gregory&start_time=6/10/16 10:00&end_time=6/10/16 10:30
> Saved as downcase
> SUCCESS

Testing for: (m=create) Not all data given by user should result in 422
GET http://localhost:3000?m=create&first_name=Mike&last_name=Gregory&start_time=6/10/16 10:30
> Gives invalid date error and 422
> SUCCESS
